Plan
=======
* Share any epiphanies, ponderings, news, or even jokes about programming. (e.g. "Why did the programmer use all the shampoo?")
* Did anyone watch that code.org movie and/or read the blog review?
* I added this link to last week's STEPS file http://phillipkerman.com/rando/js/main.js
* Vocabulary so far: properties, methods, strings, concatenation.
	* property is like an attribute and always uses this _syntax_: `instance.property` or `instance.property=value` For example: `ctx.lineStyle='#ff0000';`
	* methods usually involve more work (and probably _invoke_ functions) but the easy way to spot them is their syntax: `instance.method()` Depending on the method, the parenthesis may also accept 1 or more _parameters_. For example: `ctx.clearRect(0,0,100,100);` 
* Recap of functions introduction.
